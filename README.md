# Coming Soon — GitHub Pages

This is a minimal **Coming Soon** site ready for GitHub Pages.

## Quick start

1. Create a repository named **`USERNAME.github.io`** (replace USERNAME).
2. Upload these files to the root of the repo (`index.html` must be at top level).
3. Go to **Settings → Pages** and make sure the source is your `main` (or `master`) branch, root.
4. (Optional) Add your custom domain in **Settings → Pages → Custom domain**.
   - GitHub will create/expect a `CNAME` file with your domain.
5. Point your DNS to GitHub (see GitHub Docs).

You can customize text in `index.html` and styling in `styles.css`.
